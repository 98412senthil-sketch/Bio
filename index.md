## About

I bring **29+ years of technology experience** across banking and financial institutions — including **18+ years within a global banking organization** leading enterprise-scale systems.

Currently, I serve as a Hive Tech Lead with end-to-end responsibility for corporate banking applications — spanning architecture design, development, production deployment, and operational governance.

In recent years, my focus has expanded into **enterprise AI architecture** — specifically how deterministic systems and probabilistic AI can coexist safely within regulated decision workflows.

My work explores the intersection of:

- Deterministic policy enforcement  
- Probabilistic AI reasoning  
- Governance-first system design  
- Human-in-the-loop decision intelligence

## Featured Architecture

### AI-Assisted Client Onboarding (Governed RAG)

A governance-first AI-assisted onboarding reference architecture integrating:

- Hybrid retrieval (FAISS + metadata filtering)
- Structured LLM reasoning
- Deterministic eligibility enforcement
- Confidence-gated escalation logic

## Research & Doctrine

### Mythining Space 

WHile reading books related to Probablablistic models, I tried to relate with physical world and making working documents, to prepare as single book if possible in featire
